            My name is Javier Martinez. I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona.  I like to game, I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy novels and films, like to tinker with things, fix problems, and spending time with family. My priorities are my career, being a good father, and living life to the fullest. I graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in Criminal Justice Studies, I worked for Pima county Superior Court as a Juvenile Detention Officer and an adult Probation Officer. Eventually I decided it was time for a change and went on to pursue a career in web development.
